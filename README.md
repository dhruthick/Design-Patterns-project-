# Physical Units (of length) Converter
The application’s function is to convert the values of physical quantities (here, length) to one of its other various units of measurement. The physical value of length can vary from angstroms in the atomic world to light-years in space, while we generally use meters, kilometers, feet, inches, etc in daily life. The application is a simple calculator that returns the value of a measurement in a different unit. For length, three groups are considered as follows:  
● The general units of length
  ○ Meters
  ○ Kilometers
  ○ Feet
  ○ Yards
  ○ Inches
  ○ Furlongs
  ○ Miles
  ○ Nautical miles
● The astronomical units of length
  ○ Light years
  ○ Gigameters
  ○ Parsecs
  ○ Astronomical units
  ○ Lunar length
  ○ Light hours
● The atomic units of length
  ○ Micrometers
  ○ Picometers
  ○ Angstroms
  ○ Atomic units
  ○ Electron radius
  ○ Microinches
The app demonstrates the usuage of the Command design pattern.
